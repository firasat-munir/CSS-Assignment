            <p>"The JenWARE onesis were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter "a" and handmade quality made this gift really stand out among the cookie-cutter clothes from the department store."

                "Thanks for the cool JenWARE barware. I couldn't wait untill I found "Mr.Right", so I just bought a set for myself! My friends always want to know where I got them so I send them to your site."
